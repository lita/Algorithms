Implemented a trie with Jeff Blagdon.

We also used our trie to implement a T9 program, that returns a list of 
possible words given a sequence of numbers (0-9) based on a mapping on a 
telephone.

trie.py - The implementation of a trie
t9.py - used a trie to implement T9. Tested on a huge dictionary.
